Calculation of the prelogarithmic energy factor

In order to calculate the prelogarithmic energy factor we need to determine the
energy per unit length for a straight dislocation inside a cylinder.

The max radius will be Rmax = 15nm
==> Lz = 150A and Z=[-1100] ==> Lz = 150/sqrt(3)/3.232 ~= 26 unit cells
To keep the box as spherical as possible Lx=Lz=Ly
==> Lx = 150/3.232 = 46 unit cells
and Ly = 150/5.165 = 30 unit cells
